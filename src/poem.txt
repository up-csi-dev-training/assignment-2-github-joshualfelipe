Inside My Computer

My computer— disassembled
is a maze of cables, drives
chips and ports—an array
of connections, silver solderings,
twisting wires.

But when the satiny case
is latched in place
coils and cables disappear.
The smallest particle of matter
is not an atom, but a byte—
a particle of magic that combines
and multiplies unseen
inside the blinking box.

Creation occurs inside my computer—
friends, family rest behind the pressing
of selected keys. Words and faces
form; smiles and frowns
become feelings.
Attraction becomes addiction.

Inside my computer
dreams are imagined into reality—
inventions, hopes, ideas are born
and nurtured into happenings.
Strangers share a table, touch
hands across the world.

Inside my computer
the pulse of human hearts
waxes and wanes
as people fall in and out 
of love.
